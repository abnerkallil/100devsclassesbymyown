//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
movies = ["Panic", "Panic 2", "Panic 3"]
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let fMovie = movies[0]
console.log(fMovie)
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let moviesLen = movies.length
console.log(moviesLen)
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lMovie = movies[moviesLen -1]
console.log(lMovie)
